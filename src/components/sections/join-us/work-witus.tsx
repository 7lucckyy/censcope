          <p className="">
            In 1979, the Afghan population was suffering as a result of internal
            conflict and the Soviet invasion. Doctors, nurses, midwives and
            pharmacists of the “Aide Médicale Internationale” (AMI) association
            took action in the field, training the locals in medicine. Their
            slogan was “Let’s help them do without us”. For 31 years, AMI
            provided health support to populations in extremely hard-hit and
            conflict-affected areas, training local health staff, providing
            cross-border aid, and rebuilding medical facilities. “Backpack”
            doctors and nurses doing cross-border work became one of the calling
            cards of AMI.

            In 1992, while the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina was raging,
            three friends wanted to help the victims of this deadly war. To
            achieve their goal, they set up an organization named “Première
            Urgence”. They collected medicine and food products, rented several
            trucks, and crossed Europe to reach Sarajevo, under siege and
            constant bombing. Following this experience, they decided to devote
            their lives to humanitarian action and Première Urgence became an
            NGO focused on providing aid in emergencies.

            In 2011, the committed humanitarian workers of Première Urgence and
            the experienced doctors of Aide Médicale Internationale came
            together. They joined forces to help vulnerable populations around
            the world through humanitarian action in the form of emergency
            medical aid and the provision of health services.{" "}
            <b>Première Urgence Internationale</b> was born.

            Middle East, operating in areas of armed conflict or in response to
            hazard-related disasters. <b>Première Urgence Internationale</b> is
            now one of the largest French humanitarian NGOs.
